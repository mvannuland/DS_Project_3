## Quantifying fungal benefits to plant hosts under stress

**Description:** This project shows an example of customized scripts for linear mixed effects modeling, matrix bootstrapping, and convex hull analysis of response surface volumes in R. Data are from Van Nuland et al. (2020) "Symbiotic niche mapping reveals functional specialization by two ectomycorrhizal fungi that expands the host plant niche" in <em>Fungal Ecology</em>. 

This experiment tested how two different species of microbial root symbionts fungi (mycorrhizal fungi) influence pine tree responses to soil nutrient limitation. I hypothesized that the fungi would provide greater benefits to the plants under increasing nutrient stress, but that the extent of these positive growth effects would differ depending on the specific fungal species and type of nutrient stress (e.g., nitrogen vs. phosphorus limitation).
